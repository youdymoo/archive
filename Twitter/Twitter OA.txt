   ```sql
   select d.Name, count(e.ID) as ID_COUNT
   from Department d
   left join Employee e
   on e.DEPT_ID = d.DEPT_ID
   group by d.Name
   order by ID_COUNT desc, NAME

   SELECT
       d.DEPT_NAME,
       COUNT(s.STUDENT_ID)
   FROM
       Departments d 
       LEFT OUTER JOIN Students s ON d.DEPT_ID = s.DEPT_ID
   GROUP by
